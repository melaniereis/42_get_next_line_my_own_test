I Can't Party

I saw a cute fluff ball at the coffee shop
I asked, "Can I pet it?"
She said, "Me, or the dog?"
I said, "Whoa, quick wit"
She said, "Pull up a chair
I've got a thousand dad jokes
I've been wanting to share"

She had me in stitches
Fully tickled
Hotter than Portman
Funnier than Rickles
She said, "My friends are in town tonight
And we're all going out
They're Swedish and single
And I'm showing them around

You wanna come with?
You seem cool and artsy"
That's when I broke the news
Honey, I, I, I
I can't party
I can't party
Party
I can't party

She said, "You should really reconsider
My friends, they are a blast
And if you get too tired
You could always crash
With us in my mansion
But we all share a bed
And sometimes fool around
After we are fed

My private chef is vegan
My private chef is great
Name your favourite meal
And she'll put it on your plate"
I thought, "Wow, she's rich
And clearly a smarty"
But I needed to reiterate
I, I, I
I can't party
I can't party
Party
I can't party

I wish I could but you know I can't
(I can't party)
I wish I could but you know I can't
(I can't party)
I wish I could but you know I can't
(I can't party)
I wish I could but you know I can't

Par, par, par, par
(I can't party)
Par, par, par, par, par, par, par
(Party)
Par, par, par, par
(I can't party)
Par, par, par, par, par, par
Par
