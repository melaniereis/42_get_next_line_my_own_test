Peter Gabriel
Excuse Me

Ooh, (ooh, ooh)
Excuse me
You're wearing out my joie de vie
Grabbing those good years again
I want to be alone
A one, a two, a one, two, three
Excuse me
I'm not the man I used to be
Someone else crept in again
I wanna be alone
Excuse me, please
I'm looking for Los Angeles
Soaking up the sin again
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
You got the money back, that's okay
Who needs a Cadillac anyway?
I got the medicine, make you see the light
Call me in Alaska if it all turns out right, alright
Excuse me, please
You're standing on my memories
Stealing souvenirs again
I wanna be alone
Leave me alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
I wanna be alone
You got the money back, that's okay
Who needs a Cadillac anyway?
I got the medicine, make you see the light
Call me in Alaska, if it all turns out right, alright
