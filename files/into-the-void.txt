Nine Inch Nails
Into the Void

Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping
Talking to myself all the way to the station
Pictures in my head of the final destination
All lined up, all the ones that aren't allowed to stay
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches
Tried to overcome my complications and my catches
Nothing ever grows, and the sun doesn't shine all day
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
(Whoa-oh-oh) tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
(Whoa-oh-oh) tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
(Whoa-oh-oh) tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
(Whoa-oh-oh) tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
(Whoa-oh-oh) tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
(Whoa-oh-oh) tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
